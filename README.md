# wizards-warriors in C#
The idea is a chess x Dungeons and Dragons x RPG type game.
Basic idea is that the playing field is like a chessboard, and 2 teams spawn in the respective two halves of the map. Currently no GUI, only playing in text :)

The Map

The map is everchanging, meaning its size changes every game.I don't want it to be humongous, but it should provide a decent size to play on.

The Players

I want to be hosting a few diffrent classes, from Magic to physical, all representing a diffrent playstyle/ gameplay options.

The Fight itself

I was thinking of spawning without knowing where the opponent is and trying to find them , but honestly this idea needs to be fleshed out. 


Disclaimer

This whole this was made on a wim and now I am simply messing around with the idea. It is very basic now and I plan to upgrade it as I go along. I am currently
what one could refer to as a noob in C#, as I have recently switched to in from Java. I am a Student with a facination for Coding, but I am very lacking, so 
please bear that in mind.
